# Mechanistic Insights into the Non-Covalent Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro: A Multiscale Computational Study

This repository contains data and analyses from our multiscale computational study on the non-covalent inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro2), a critical viral enzyme involved in both viral polyprotein processing and host immune evasion.
We evaluated a diverse set of inhibitors—including GRL0617 analogs, XR-series compounds, and repurposed drugs—using a combination of molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, MM/GBSA and SIE binding free energy calculations, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Free Energy Landscape (FEL) analysis, residue-based energy decomposition, and Protein–Ligand Interaction Fingerprinting (ProLIF).
